# Logo-Generator

  ## Description
  This project uses inquirer to obtain user input and uses the input to generate a Logo with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The application runs on the terminal and prompts users to select a shape, a shape color, text, and text color. The application will then use Javascript to assign the collected data to shape class attributes and later interpolate the data on a SVG file using the File System writeFile method.
